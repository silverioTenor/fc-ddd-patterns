# FC - DDD Patterns and Clean Arch

To execute this project run:

```
npm start
```

Once executed, access **_http://localhost:3000/docs_** in your browser to view the application's swagger. After that, it's time to play.<br>
Optionally, you can access the files with the calls to the endpoints located in the project root **_public/http_** to achieve the same goal, which is to consume the API. Or you can use any client you want.

However, if your goal is just to run unit and integration tests, then run the following command:

```
npm test
```
